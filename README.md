# Databases-for-Spectral-Color-Science

# To-do

- Write summary in readme
- Set up github.io
- Work out how to push markdown file to github.io

Best URL for this project is currently [da5nsy.github.io/Databases-for-Spectral-Color-Science/](//da5nsy.github.io/Databases-for-Spectral-Color-Science/).

I would prefer it to not have my username in but maybe that is fine.

I would also prefer that it didn't redirect to https://www.dannygarside.co.uk/Databases-for-Spectral-Color-Science/ but it doesn't look like there is a way around that right now - see: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/547
